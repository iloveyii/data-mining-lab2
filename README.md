# Objective
In this lab, you shall
1. Learn how to apply various clustering techniques
2. Evaluate the performance of your implementation
* Note: You may implement your own classification code from scratch or build on
available tools.
* A dataset containing 200K rows is given. It contains a two attribute dataset (x,y).
Each row is a point in a 2D plane. Your task is to identify the data clusters.

# Task1:
* You shall apply the k-means algorithm for k=2,3,....
* Repeat the above for k-medioid.
# Task2:
* Repeat the above task using your favourite hierarchical algorithms.
Compare your results (accuracy) with that you found in Task1.

# Report:
 * How many clusters can you see in this data? (What is the plausible number of
clusters?). Motivate your answer using:
    - Mathematical analysis.
    - Visual analysis (e.g. plotting XY graph on Excel)
* Present a comparison of your results in the two tasks by evaluating the execution results for
1-2 and by examining the implementation of the algorithm for 3-4 below:
    1. Accuracy results
    2. Performance (execution time)
    3. Resource efficiency (Memory consumption)
    4. Parallelizability 
    
* Show your comparisons in tabular form, present each taskâ€™s result as a column.
